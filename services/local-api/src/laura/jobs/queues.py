"""Queue names and routing policy (docs/05-workers-queue.md).

The claim already orders by ``priority DESC, created_at ASC`` and filters by queue, so
priority and routing happen in the database. This module names the queues and groups
them into CPU vs GPU: CPU work runs anywhere, while the GPU queue (ASR / forced
alignment / diarization / embeddings) is consumed only by workers that have the heavy
ML extras and a GPU. The desktop runner consumes all queues; server-mode workers start
with a queue subset (``CPU_QUEUES`` or ``GPU_QUEUES``) so GPU stages land on GPU hosts.
