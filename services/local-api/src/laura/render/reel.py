"""Pure ffmpeg video-filter chain builder for social-media reel exports.

No I/O, no ffmpeg calls — only string manipulation. The returned string is
ready to be passed as the value of an ffmpeg ``-vf`` / ``-filter_complex`` option.

Overlay text is supplied via drawtext ``textfile=`` (a *basename*, resolved
against ffmpeg's working directory), NOT inline ``text='…'``. This is a
deliberate correctness choice: arbitrary user text (apostrophes, colons,
commas, ``%``) cannot be escaped reliably for inline drawtext on Windows, and
inline text is also a filtergraph-injection vector. A file read verbatim by
ffmpeg removes both problems. The caller writes the file and passes its
basename (see ``render_clips_mp4``). The basename must be free of ffmpeg filter
metacharacters — callers control it, so we keep this builder pure.

    Filter order:
    1. Reframe to 9:16 (1080 × 1920)              — when *vertical* is True.
       * Default (``reel_fit=False``): center-crop, clamped to the source
         (``crop='min(iw,ih*9/16)':'min(ih,iw*16/9)', scale=1080:1920``).  Fills the frame
         but may cut off content that is off-center.  The clamp keeps a source already
         narrower/taller than 9:16 from requesting a crop larger than the frame.
       * Fit mode (``reel_fit=True``): scale-to-fit with letterbox padding
         (``scale=1080:1920:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease:force_divisible_by=2,
         pad=1080:1920:(1080-iw)/2:(1920-ih)/2:black``).  The whole source frame is kept
         visible; dead space is filled with black bars and the frame is centred on both
         axes.  Use for screencasts or any content where center-crop would slice off
         readable text or UI.
    2. Centered top ``drawtext``                   — when *hook_textfile* is set.
    3. Bottom-right ``drawtext``                   — when *disclosure_textfile* is set.

    Note: this function does NOT handle ``reel_blur_fill`` mode.  That mode requires a
    split/overlay sub-graph that cannot be expressed as a simple comma chain.  See

    (:func:`laura.render.mp4.render_clips_mp4`) for how it is wired in.

        font:                 Resolved fontfile path passed verbatim to drawtext.

    Produces a 1080 × 1920 (9:16) output from an arbitrary-aspect-ratio input by:
      1. Splitting the input into two copies (``split``).
      2. Background copy: scale-to-cover 1080×1920 (``force_original_aspect_ratio=increase``)
         + exact ``crop=1080:1920`` + heavy Gaussian blur (``boxblur=20:2``).

         preserving every pixel of the source frame.
      4. Overlay foreground centred on blurred background (``overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2``).

    This is the industry-standard "blurred-background fill" used by Instagram Reels /
    TikTok for landscape-to-vertical conversion: no black bars, no cropped content.

    The fragment is a *sub-graph* with internal labels — it must be embedded inside a
    larger ``-filter_complex`` string (separated by ``;``).  The caller connects
    ``in_label`` from the preceding stage and reads ``out_label`` for the next stage
    (e.g. drawtext / ass captions).

    Drawtext/ASS caption filters must be applied AFTER this graph (on the composited
    1080×1920 stream) — the caller is responsible for chaining them.

    Example (single-clip hard-cut path):
        ``[vcat]split=2[_bbg][_bfg];[_bbg]scale=...,boxblur=20:2[_bbl];
