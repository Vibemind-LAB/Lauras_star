"""Render a list of timeline clip segments into one MP4 via ffmpeg (trim + concat).

Hard cuts use a single ``concat`` (byte-identical to the pre-crossfade renderer). When any
boundary carries a real ``crossfade`` transition the video/audio assembly switches to a
pairwise fold: ``xfade``/``acrossfade`` with a **reserve overlap** (clip A is extended by the
transition duration into its post-cut source handles), so the assembled length stays exactly
the sum of clip content lengths (sync invariant) and B loses no content.

Multi-lane compositing (§7 of the free-multitrack spec):
When ``render_multilane_mp4`` is called with clips on multiple lanes, each lane is assembled
as an independent segment chain (real clips interleaved with colour/transparent gap segments),
then lanes are stacked via ``overlay=eof_action=pass`` in ascending lane order (lane 0 is the
opaque base; lanes ≥ 1 carry ``yuva420p`` transparent gaps so lower lanes show through).
Single-lane timelines delegate to ``render_clips_mp4`` byte-identically.

    Strategy (per §7 of the free-multitrack spec):

    **Lane 0 (base)**: real clips plus explicit opaque-black gap segments, concatenated into
    one continuous stream that covers the full sequence length.  Lane 0 drives the timing of
    the whole overlay stack.  Gap colour sources use ``color=c=black`` (no size — ffmpeg
    defaults to ``320x240``; the overlay filter scales the overlay to the base resolution, so
    size mismatches between gaps and real clips on lane 0 must be avoided by using the same
    default).  In practice, lane-0 timelines should not have gaps (the per-lane packing policy
    keeps lane 0 contiguous); the gap path is a safety net.

    **Lanes ≥ 1 (overlay)**: **no explicit gap segments** — instead each real clip is trimmed
    and its PTS is shifted by ``seq_in_frame / TB`` so it appears at the correct absolute
    sequence position.  The ``overlay=eof_action=pass:repeatlast=0`` filter passes the base
    through unchanged for timestamps where the overlay has no frames (before the clip starts
    and after it ends).  Multiple clips on the same overlay lane are each applied as a
    separate overlay stage (fold: ``base ← overlay_clip1 ← overlay_clip2 …``).  This avoids
    any size-mismatch concat issue and is the standard ffmpeg pattern for sparse overlays.

    Returns ``(real_clips, filter_complex, out_label)`` where:
    - ``real_clips`` is the ordered list of ``(path, src_in, src_out)`` for ALL real clip
      segments across all lanes, in the order the ``-i`` inputs must appear.
    - ``filter_complex`` is the full filter string (pass to ``-filter_complex``).
    - ``out_label`` is ``"[vout]"`` (the final composited video label).

    IMPORTANT: pure function — no IO, fully unit-testable.

    ``base_input_offset``: start index of real-clip inputs in the global ``-i`` list (non-zero
    when the caller prepends other ``-i`` entries before the video clips).

    Single-lane MUST NOT be routed through this function — the caller routes single-lane

    """Trim each clip by frame range (end-exclusive) and concat into one MP4.

    ``music_tracks`` is an optional list of
    ``(path, seq_in_frame, seq_out_frame_exclusive, gain_percent)`` tuples.
    Each track is mixed into the output audio at the specified position:

    * ``seq_in_frame`` / ``seq_out_frame_exclusive`` define the window inside
      the assembled sequence where the track should be audible (integer frames,
      end-exclusive — consistent with the frame-accuracy invariant).
    * ``gain_percent`` is applied as a ``volume`` filter (100 = unity gain).

    With no tracks (or ``music_tracks=None``) the output is video-only
    (unchanged — backward compatible).

    ``audio_overlays`` is the structured v2 equivalent for sequence-level audio
    clips. It adds ``asset_in_frame`` and simple fade-in/out frame ranges while
    preserving the same end-exclusive sequence placement.

    ``caption_ass`` is an optional complete ASS document string (as returned by
    ``build_ass``).  When set, the subtitles are burned into the output using
    the ffmpeg ``ass=`` filter.  The file is written next to *dest*, added to
    the ``reel_files`` cleanup list, and removed after the render regardless of
    success or failure.  Defaults to ``None`` (no captions, byte-identical to
    the pre-R1.2 behaviour).

    ``caption_srt`` is an optional complete SRT document string (as returned by
    ``sequence_transcript_to_srt``).  When set, the subtitles are burned into
    the output using the ffmpeg ``subtitles=`` filter.  The file is written next
    to *dest*, cleaned up afterwards, and the ``subtitles=`` filter is appended
    after any ASS caption filter.  Defaults to ``None`` (off).  When both
    ``caption_ass`` and ``caption_srt`` are provided, ASS takes precedence and
    the SRT is ignored.

    ``loudnorm`` (default ``False``) appends an EBU R128 ``loudnorm`` stage
    (``I=-14:TP=-1.5:LRA=11`` — the common social-media loudness target) as the
    final step of the audio graph when the output has audio.  With it off (or no
    audio) the audio graph is byte-identical to the pre-loudnorm behaviour.

    ``reel_fit`` (default ``False``) switches the vertical reframe from center-crop to
    letterbox fit when ``vertical=True``.  Use for screencasts or any content where
    center-crop would slice off readable text.  Has no effect when ``vertical=False``.

    ``reel_blur_fill`` (default ``False``) switches to *blurred-background fill* mode when
    ``vertical=True``.  The source frame is scaled to fit 1080×1920 (no cropping), and the
    top/bottom dead space is filled with a heavily blurred, scale-to-cover copy of the same
    frame.  This produces the Instagram/TikTok "reel fill" look instead of black bars.
    Precedence: ``reel_blur_fill`` > ``reel_fit`` > center-crop (default).  Has no effect
    when ``vertical=False`` or when ``vertical=True`` but ``reel_blur_fill=False``.
    Because the blur-fill requires a ``split``/``overlay`` sub-graph it is wired directly
    into the ``filter_complex`` string rather than through the comma-chain returned by
    :func:`reel_video_chain` — drawtext and ASS captions are still applied on top of the
    composited 1080×1920 stream, so caption output is identical to the other vertical modes.

    ``zoom_specs`` (default ``None``) switches on the ``zoom_hybrid`` fit mode: a
    ``list[ZoomSpec | None]`` that must align 1:1 with ``clips`` (``None`` entries fall back to
    plain blur-fill for that segment).  When set, the video graph is built by
    :func:`zoom_concat_graph` (per-segment blurred full frame dissolving into a static
    end-window crop) instead of the crossfade/concat assembly; captions, disclosure/hook
    drawtext, and the audio graph are layered on top exactly as in the other paths — only the
    ``[vcat]``-producing video branch differs.  v1 scope: requires ``vertical=True`` and excludes
    ``video_transitions`` (both raise ``ValueError``), and ``len(zoom_specs) != len(clips)``
    raises ``ValueError``.  With ``zoom_specs=None`` (default) every path is byte-identical to
    today.

    ``lane_clip_rows`` is a list-of-lists indexed by lane number.  Each inner list contains
    ``(path, src_in, src_out, seq_in, seq_out_excl)`` tuples for the clips on that lane,
    already sorted by ``seq_in``.  The outer list must have at least 2 entries (for lane 0 and
    at least one overlay lane); lanes with no clips should be represented as empty lists and are
    skipped by the compositor.

    **Single-lane regression:** this function is NEVER called when only lane 0 has clips — the
    caller (``handlers.py``) routes single-lane timelines to ``render_clips_mp4`` unchanged to
    preserve byte-identity.

    Lane 0 is the opaque base chain; lanes ≥ 1 are transparent overlay chains stacked on top in
    ascending lane order (lane 1 directly above lane 0, lane 2 above lane 1, etc.).  Gaps (time
    spans on a lane with no clip) are filled with colour sources: opaque black for lane 0,
    transparent black (``alpha=0``) for overlay lanes so lower lanes show through.

    Audio comes only from lane-0 clips (V1) — overlay clips are silent B-roll in v1.  Music and
    ``audio_overlays`` work exactly as in ``render_clips_mp4``.  Captions and reel features are
    NOT exposed here (v1 scope: composite the video stack; captions/reels remain single-lane).
