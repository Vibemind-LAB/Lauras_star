"""v2 production run entrypoint: Production Board lifecycle + resume-aware task contract.

:func:`run_production` is the v2 counterpart of :func:`orchestrator.run_short_creator`: instead
of a single flat task prompt, it opens (or creates) a session's :class:`board.Board` first, asks
:func:`build_production_task` to describe the CURRENT board state as part of the task text (so a
resumed run does not redo finished work), then runs the fixed five-agent production team
(:mod:`production_agents`) through a small magentic-only A/B escalation ladder. v2 has no
GraphFlow fallback, so unlike v1's ``orchestrator._run_stage`` a hard failure at Stage A goes
straight to Stage B instead of trying GraphFlow first at Stage A.

Team execution stays injectable (``execute: ExecuteFn | None``) for the same reason as v1: the
ladder policy is fully testable without an LLM (:func:`orchestrator._safe_execute` guarantees a
raising ``execute`` still becomes a clean ``hard_fail`` outcome, so ``run_production`` itself
never raises). The default executor lazily builds the real
:func:`production_agents.build_production_team` and runs it with ``asyncio.run`` (mirrors
:func:`orchestrator._default_execute`); it is board-bound (the team needs ``board``/``asset_id``/
``deps``), so it is built as a closure rather than a bare module-level function, and only imports
``asyncio`` inside its own body — no autogen (nor anything that transitively needs it) is
imported at this module's top level.
