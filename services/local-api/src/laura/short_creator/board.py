"""Versioned artifact store for v2 production sessions (the "Production Board").

Layout under ``<workspace>/agent-runs/<session_id>/board/``::

    meta.json                       BoardMeta
    scene_reviews/scene_<n>.json    one SceneReview per scene
    storyline.json .. qa_report.json  singleton artifacts (see _SINGLETONS)
    versions/<stem>.v<k>.json       append-only archive of every replaced version

Writes are atomic (uniquely named tmp + replace), JSON-guarded, and serialized by a
process-wide per-board lock; reads heal the valid-prefix corruption class in place
(see ``_read_model``).  Invalidation always runs *downstream* along ``_CHAIN`` —
never upstream — so cached upstream work (above all: scene reviews) survives every
adjust/revert.
