"""Production-board infrastructure, board-read tools, and the VLM scene review (Slice 3).

``build_production_tool_specs`` wraps the Production Board (:mod:`.board`) as agent-facing
tools, mirroring :func:`laura.short_creator.toolset.build_tool_specs`'s closure pattern: ``db``
and ``board`` are captured once, each function stays a clean ``dict[str, Any]``-in/-out
callable, and its docstring becomes the tool's LLM-facing description. Pure — no autogen import
here; the agent wiring wraps these as ``FunctionTool``s elsewhere.

:class:`ProductionDeps` is the seam every model/ffmpeg call goes through: tests inject fakes,
production passes ``deps=None`` and each tool resolves the real backend lazily (mirrors
:func:`laura.short_creator.context.describe_moment`'s ``backend if backend is not None else
resolve_describe_backend()`` pattern) — so a missing model or proxy degrades instead of failing.

The Slice-3 core is ``review_scene``: it looks at 3 real frames (start/middle/end) of a
rough-cut scene with a VLM and writes a validated ``SceneReview`` to the board. It NEVER raises
and never blocks the pipeline — no configured backend, an empty reply, unparseable JSON, or
failed frame extraction all fall back to a **degraded** review built from the scene's transcript
alone (``degraded=True``, ``roi=None``, a neutral ``hook_score``), which is still written to the
board so the pipeline can proceed. Every tool function additionally catches unexpected
exceptions at its own boundary and reports them as ``{"ok": False, "reason": ...}`` instead of
raising — the agent loop must never die on a tool.

``save_storyline``/``save_script_chapter`` are the first *write* tools past scene review: they
pydantic-validate their input and report a malformed payload as ``{"ok": False, "errors": [...]}``
(loc+msg strings, agent-correctable) rather than raising. ``save_storyline`` additionally refuses
to save chapters that reference a scene without a review yet, or a review window the scene does
not have — a ``scene_numbers`` entry is a plain scene number (window 0) or ``{"scene": N,
"window": K}``, the same scene may recur with different windows, the same pair never twice.
``save_script_chapter`` merges by
chapter (other chapters' lines are kept, only the given chapter's lines are replaced) and, like
every ``board.save()`` call, invalidates every artifact downstream in the chain (voice, cutlist,
render report, qa report).

``synthesize_script_voice``/``build_cutlist`` are the Slice-3 core toolkit (Task 5).
``synthesize_script_voice`` turns the board's script into an mp3 + word-timings sidecar through
``deps.voice_backend`` (falling back to :func:`laura.short_creator.voice.resolve_voice_backend`,
same graceful-without-config pattern as the VLM). It, ``build_cutlist`` and ``render_production``
all read the script's lines through :func:`_lines_in_storyline_order` first — the STORYLINE's
scene order, not the order the lines happen to be written in — so the spoken narration, the
word-time map and the picture all walk the same sequence; a sha256 of that ORDERED text
(:func:`script_hash`) is the synthesis cache key, so an unrelated board change is a no-op re-run
while a storyline reorder (which changes the text) correctly busts the cache. ``build_cutlist``
is a *pure derivation* — no model or backend calls — turning storyline + script + voice into a
frame-accurate ``Cutlist``: one ``CutSegment`` per scene entry in arc order, cut from the review
window the entry references (offset, per-window roi — duration is budget-driven, never the
window's own duration), clamped inside its own source range, with an optional zoom timed to when
the scene's script line is actually spoken (the voice sidecar's word ``start_s``, via
:func:`line_starts`, offset by ``transition_lead_s``).
Segment durations are coupled to that same sidecar: :func:`chapter_audio_windows` tiles the
voice track into per-chapter windows (boundaries midway between adjacent chapters' words, the
last chapter running to voice end + a short tail) and ``_scale_chapter_durations`` rescales each
chapter's base durations (:func:`_segment_duration_s`) to fill exactly its window — 2s floor per
segment, hard-capped at the scene's end-exclusive frame boundary — so the picture's chapter
boundaries track the continuous voice instead of drifting apart (chapter word-shares are not
chapter time-shares).

``save_contact_sheet`` is the Kontaktbogen checkpoint between cutlist and render: one grid PNG
over the cutlist (each segment's window-middle frame out of the editorial proxy, tiles in segment
order, labeled ``<order> S<scene_number>``), saved as the board's ``contact_sheet`` artifact —
the chain link between ``cutlist`` and ``render_report``, so a cutlist change archives and
invalidates the sheet like any other downstream artifact. Purely mechanical ffmpeg (PNG frames —
NOT mjpeg, which breaks on non-full-range YUV proxies — then the ``tile`` filter); labels are
drawn with ``drawtext`` from a small cross-platform font-candidate list and degrade to an
unlabeled sheet (``labeled=False``) when no usable font exists, rather than failing the
checkpoint. The user steers around this checkpoint purely via follow-up ``/message`` calls
("build up to the contact sheet, then stop" / "render now") — no new session state.

``render_production``/``review_export``/``save_qa_report`` close out the pipeline (Task 6).
``render_production`` turns the cutlist into the actual render call (``deps.render_segments``,
falling back to the real :func:`laura.mcp.tools.tool_render_segments`, resolved lazily like every
other backend seam): segments and an index-aligned zoom hint per segment, the board's voice as
the new audio track, captions on, blur-filled onto the board format's canvas — then polls the
resulting export
(bounded by ``RENDER_WAIT_SECONDS``, same pattern as :func:`laura.short_creator.toolset`'s
``export_status``) and grades it against three checks (``voice_fits``, ``export_ready``,
``has_voice_timings``); the ``RenderReport`` is saved regardless of the verdict so a failing
render stays inspectable, and the coding-agent's remedy for a too-short video is a longer cutlist
budget, NEVER a shortened voice (see the tool's own docstring). ``review_export`` grabs a few real
frames of the finished export (``_grab_video_frames``, one ffmpeg seek per timestamp — a failed
grab just yields fewer frames, never raises) and has the VLM QA-check each one individually,
degrading to an empty, explicitly-flagged note list without a configured backend. ``save_qa_report``
is the last board write: pydantic-validated verdict + findings, same self-correcting error contract
as ``save_storyline``/``save_script_chapter``.

``revert_artifact`` (Slice 4, Task 2) is the coding agent's one content-editing tool: it restores
an archived version of a singleton artifact as current and invalidates everything downstream of
it, exactly like a fresh ``board.save`` would — the normal pipeline tools then regenerate those
downstream artifacts. It reads ``downstream_of(name)`` and snapshots which of those are actually
present BEFORE calling ``board.revert`` (which deletes them), so the returned ``invalidated`` list
reflects what is about to disappear rather than what is already gone. An unknown artifact name
never reaches ``board.revert`` at all — it is rejected with the valid name list up front — and a
version that was never archived reports ``{"ok": False, "reason": "no archived <name> v<version>"}``
instead of raising, matching every other tool's error contract.

        which one is missing instead of raising (storyline is also a transitive prerequisite of
        build_cutlist, but is re-checked directly here since it is needed again to put the
        caption/voiceover text back in the SAME storyline scene order the cutlist's segments
        are in — see _lines_in_storyline_order). Turns the cutlist into (start_frame,
        end_frame_exclusive) segments plus an index-aligned zoom hint per segment
        (only where that segment has BOTH a roi and a zoom_start_s; otherwise None), and renders
        them with captions on and a blur-filled letterbox onto the canvas the board's format
        selects (insta 1080x1920, x 1920x1080, linkedin 1080x1080), plus the board's voice as
        the new audio track. Polls the resulting export (bounded by
        RENDER_WAIT_SECONDS) until it leaves the "rendering" state, then grades three checks:
        voice_fits (the rendered video covers the whole voice track, small tolerance),
        export_ready, and has_voice_timings (captions can be burned in). The RenderReport is
        saved to the board regardless of the verdict, so a failing render stays inspectable.

        CODING-AGENT CHARTER: if voice_fits comes back False, do NOT shorten or cut the voice —
        build_cutlist already sizes segments to the voice's chapter audio windows, so a
        shortfall means the scene material ran out (segments hit their scene-end caps) or the
        voice has no timings sidecar. Re-run build_cutlist and render again; if it still fails,
        the chapters need more/longer scenes (a storyline decision — report it), or, in the
        sidecar-less fallback, a longer per-chapter time budget. The voice is the script the
        team already agreed on; the video must fit it.
