"""The v2 production-team agent roster (AutoGen ``AssistantAgent``s) — Slice 3, Task 7.

Five specialists turn a reviewed rough cut into a shipped short by writing to, and reading from,
the Production Board (:mod:`.board`) — never talking directly to each other about content, only
through board artifacts (scene reviews -> storyline -> script -> voice/cutlist/render -> QA). The
pipeline is a fixed judgment chain: ``vision_reviewer`` (what is actually on screen) ->
``story_architect`` (the arc) -> ``scene_author`` (the words) -> ``coding_agent`` (voice, cutlist,
render — execution only, plus reverting the board to an earlier artifact version when explicitly
asked to) -> ``qa_reviewer`` (ship or revise on the rendered result). Each tool name in the roster
is cross-checked in tests against :func:`production_tools.build_production_tool_specs`'s real
tool names.

Mirrors :mod:`.agents`/:mod:`.magentic`'s split: :func:`production_agent_specs` is pure data (no
autogen, no db — testable standalone) and :func:`build_production_team` is the only
autogen-touching constructor here, lazily importing the optional ``autoshort`` extra and wiring
one shared agent-role model client plus a separate orchestrator-role client into a
``MagenticOneGroupChat``, exactly like :func:`laura.short_creator.magentic.build_magentic_team`.
